Stratagy Reminder: 

Rule 1: Count Gains in Bitcoin, not USD. 

Rule 2: Only invest in altcoins when (1) Bitcoin AND Global Charts are in uptrend (21EMA above 55EMA above 100EMA on daily), (2) There is no Bitcoin bias news (eg upcoming fork, upcoming btc dominant news). Otherwise bias Bitcoin when neutral and USD when explicitly short. 

Rule 3: Never have static long term holdings. All holdings are dynamic and ready to be liquidated at a moments notice. 

Rule 4: Never hold more than 15 Altcoins in core portfolio at any one time.

Rule 5: 3% of Portfolio allocated to 'shitcoins'.
